### Day 40: August 03, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I finalized the design & clean the code of the profile creation page of my website. I set the box-shadow to inset in CSS and discover that it gives a 3-dimensional look to the form (I think Grinning face with smiling eyes).
			Then I made a pull request to my mentor. And I learn a lot and getting more familiar and improve in CSS. I learn how to add a custom placeholder to select tag because there is no such. I also make the page responsive.

**Thoughts**:  I spent 5 hours today in coding. And I see that if you want to do and finish something, your attention to time will lose. Just focus.

### Day 41: August 04, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  I made some adjustments to my code. I was told to create a separate component for a select tag that had so many options and make the current component long. I connect the parent & child component using refs and emit.

**Thoughts**:  I spent 3 hours in coding today. I realized that the way you solved a problem is based on your knowledge on different WAYS to solve it. So I have to study deeper in vue.js and find out more ways to solve a problem.
		I need to learn more on how to communicate parent-child relationship in components like using Bus.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 42: August 05, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I spent two nearly 2 hours today in coding. I solved my problem on how to make a date dropdown(from DATE Object) that will output correct days based on the month given. (Ex: Feb. = 28 days).

**Thoughts**:  I learn something new and ANOTHER WAY to solve a problem, in #vuejs called lifecycle hooks. It's very useful. I used beforeMount to execute a function when page loads.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 43: August 06, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  I build the date dropdown that updates the day based on the month you selected. Ex: If you select feb, it had 28days.

**Thoughts**:  I look on facebook date dropdown and I can input invalid date like Feb 31. Maybe they are using server side validation.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 44: August 07, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Another happy day because I finally solve my problem in making the date dropdown and finished revising my code.

**Thoughts**:  I've been little bit confused in some logic(and, or, nand, nor, etc) I had to study more of it to solve another problem regarding date form validation in my project.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 45: August 09, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I study #veutify. I also add some form-validation. A complicated combination of 'and', 'or', 'not' gives me a hard time, and I took a review.

**Thoughts**:  I'm excited to apply vuetify in my project. It does not come to my mind a 'component framework' that enables you to add ready-made component.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 46: August 10, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I make my error message in form validation reactive(when the right answer was given, the error message will be removed).

**Thoughts**:   I also started to realize the usefulness of #npm. A lot of components are already made you just had to install it.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 47: August 11, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  An amazing day for me cause I learn a lot today and finally solved my long-time problem regarding vue-router. I cannot use it bec. the 3.x version is not yet compatible with Vue 3. So I just updated it to 4.0 beta. I'm so happy.

**Thoughts**:   I decided to take a note while studying and coding and note about evrything I learned and did. Here's what I learned today: git restore, git reset, npm update, npm outdated, software release life cycle(alpha, beta, release candidate, stable released, etc.) package.json and package-lock.json.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 48: August 12, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I applied and used vue-router in my side-menu. Because before I just used v-show to hide and show the components. But now I understand the vue-router that it changes the URL and history. It's the right thing to do.

**Thoughts**:   I learned about '!important' that makes a css property priority.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 49: August 13, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  A satisfying and productive day. I finally finished another project. I've finished revising the side menu that uses vue-router and finalized the code and design. 

**Thoughts**:   I'm so happy I finally applied the vue-router in my project. It's my problem and desire to do for a long time. Tomorrow I'll begin a new project.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 51: August 15, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  I continue to build the clinic profile creation page today and I learned more on vuetify and how to make a modal component.

**Thoughts**:   The new Vue 3.x always gives me a hard time becuase many package are not yet compatible with it. Additionally, I used vite. So I encounter a lot of errors for example in installing vuetify.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 52: August 16, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  I code a little today and finished the clinic-profile creation component.

### Day 53: August 17, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I've finally put overlay to my components. I learned about: transition tag in vue, transition property in CSS, linear-gradient color, customizing scrollbar, etc.

**Thoughts**:    How I long to do put an overlay to my component. I've finally did it! Tomorrow I'll clear the code and design and finalized it and center the components.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 54: August 18, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  I made a customize multi-select dropdown because I cannot use already made from #npm because these libraries are not yet compatible with Vue 3. I also fixed my customize scrollbar.

**Thoughts**:    I'm glad I learn and did something no matter how small. Tomorrow, I want to finish the page and finalized the design and code.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 55: August 19, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:   I spent only two hours. I've clear the design and function of my multi-select dropdown. Though I encounter an error and it gives me a hard time, I learned about and how to make #vuejs custom directives. It was amazing.

**Thoughts**:    I need to study more on vue custom directives and totally apply it. Btw, someone answer my question in  stackoverflow after a month and he answer it right cause I already figure it out that my problem is I used Vue 3 and not Vue 2 in the error in my question.

### Day 58: August 22, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:   I fix the responsiveness of the new page. I fix the margin and the z-index of the clinic-profile-creation component.

**Thoughts**:   I saw that as the project gets larger, the more time you need to spend in adding a feature because the code became complicated, & sometimes you need to adjust some code to fit the new feature.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 59: August 23, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:   I'm busy today on other things but I'd be able to code and fix bugs and error in my code and design.I'd fix the margin of the profile creation components, the z-index of navigaition against button in home components and the error message position in mobile view.

**Thoughts**:   One of these days I'll show the update to my website and I'll begin another project.

**Today's Progress**:   An hour today for my project and  I just add another button that pushes the collected data to an array and cleans the input fields. I spend the rest in fixing an error.

**Thoughts**:   I wonder how many percent of our coding time we gave to debugging errors?.

**Thoughts**:    Today I learned about CSS methods, naming conventions and BEM. I remember when I required to use BEM in an exam in one of the company where I applied. Now I understand it, I will study it more and I will apply it.

### Day 65: August 30, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:   Spent an hour in coding and designing the day and time list on my project. I'd be able to also add the edit button if you want to edit the list.

**Thoughts**:    I'll do my best to code daily at least an hour cause I'll be busy these coming days at work.

### Day 66: September 01, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:   It's a wonderful day! I finished the clinic profile creation component. It takes me some time but it's all worth it. I learned a lot. You can now set a different schedule for different days.

**Thoughts**:    I just had to finalize some function and data and clean the code and design tomorrow. Then I can start a new project.

### Day 67: September 02, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:   Spent 4hours today. I add form validation that makes the user unable to add schedule if there is no time to a day and vice versa. I also made the schedule object that will make the schedule easy to access when sent to the server.

**Thoughts**:    Tomorrow I'll Add Select All Checkbox and finally make a pull request.

### Day 68: September 03, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:   Spent 4hrs and add the select all checkbox. It looks easy but it is not. I made a pull request and will begin another feature for the website.

**Thoughts**:    Maybe I'm slow in making a project but I'm confident it was functioning well and no bugs whatever the user did.

### Day 69: September 04, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**:   I made a new component for my website which is patient profile creation. I also fix a small error but takes me some time to find it. I also update outdated packages.

**Thoughts**:     I wonder how long it takes to fixed an error to a very big project?

### Day 70: September 05, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:   I've finished the patient profile creation component based on the requirements. It's almost finished since I just copy the code from clinic profile creation component. I just added new field and remove other fields.

**Thoughts**:     It's getting easier because I'm now familiar with it. I think the thrilling part of programming is you always learn something new. I also thought of make one component for these 'profile creation' components. Since they are all the same, I just pass a prop to the component and the component will display the field I want to display through props. Will it work?

### Day 71: September 06, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:   I add the optional owner name input and ownership-date dropdown input to the component. So the component now had two date-dropdown input.

**Thoughts**:     These component is almost finished and therefore the fastest feature I made. I just had to fix the design and put input box to right places.

### Day 72: September 08, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:   I finalized the code, design, and form validation of the profile creation page. It's great to learn about setCustomValidity, and pattern attribute in #HTML. It makes custom form validation easier by using only HTML.

**Thoughts**:     No thoughts for today, for the first time. XD

### Day 73: September 09, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:   I code for an hour and update the patient profile component based on what my mentor told me and study about API, cause I had to enable the page to receive data from the server.

**Thoughts**:     I'm excited to learned about API, Ajax, and fetching data from the server. It's another thing to learn and a new challenge to face. By the way, today is my 8th spiritual birthday. The glorious day when I received Christ Jesus in my heart.

### Day 81: September 19, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:   Spent my time solving a logical error that appeared after I update to #vuejs 3 official release. When I go back to previous Vue RC, my code works well again.

**Thoughts**:    I think there are some changes or something error with the Vue source code? Kidding.

### Day 83: September 23, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:   Spent 3 hours and I'd separate the model from the view-model in my vuejs code. I used and learned more about ES6 import and export.

**Thoughts**:    I thought it was hard to apply MVVM in my vue.js code but it is not. Vue.js is already an MVVM architecture. I just had to seperate the model from view-model, thats the requirement.

### Day 84: September 24, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:   I just fixed my code that I didn't finished yesterday. I fully separate the model from view-model.

### Day 85: September 25, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**:   Today I apply the MVVM architecture, separate the model and other changes I made, across all the components I made in the past.

**Thoughts**:    I learn that when a project is getting bigger, a little change in your code takes time to do.

### Day 86: September 28, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:   I'd finished updating and applying MVVM architecture to all the components of my Veterinary Website. I can finally begin a new feature for my website.

**Thoughts**:    I did not code yesterday and I code the other day but did not report cause I want to report or log something that is wort reporting. I'll share the link here once this website was finished.

### Day 87: September 29, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:   Today, I clean and finalized my code and made a pull request to my mentor. I learned about autocomplete property in HTML that was needed to add for the best experience of web users

**Thoughts**:    I think I should be more specific in writing my progress not just for me to easy to understand and recall when I read it but also for the other people who read my progress. God bless us all!

### Day 88: September 30, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:   Today I separate viewmodel from view so View, Model, and Viewmodel are now separated. I also apply export default to my code in model.

**Thoughts**:    I learned about 'Separation of Concerns'. This is what I missed and what my mentor trying to teach me for the past week. But I did not apply bec. what I'm doing is SFC in vuejs. Now I understand. And I learned one of the common mistakes of a CodeNewbie.

### Day 89: October 01, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:   Today I start making the appointments component where the clinic can view and edit the appointments. It is a table of schedule that contains information about the client, patient, etc.

**Thoughts**:     It's my first time to use the table tag in HTML in my project though use it before it school but cannot understand.

### Day 90: October 03, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:   I made the appointment list component on my website. I learn about contentEditable in HTML where you can edit an element in HTML when it is set to true. There's still a lot to add like the time and design.

**Thoughts**:     It was thrilling and I felt much excitement while doing this new project. I saw my improvement and I'm faster than ever.

### Day 91: October 05, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I just fix some error and design in my HTML table where I want to put a button. I just made a separate cell for the button and the problem was fixed. I also try to make the component focuses on the content when you click edit button.

**Thoughts**:     I must code earlier to sleep earlier. I must plan what should I do before I start coding for me to have a goal and make my time productive.

### Day 92: October 07, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I learn about $nextTick in #vuejs, a function that executes a callback AFTER the DOM updates. I also solve another problem by applying scopes, a basic javascript principle.

**Thoughts**:      I'm so happy today cause I solve many problems in my code. $nextTick will be very helpful to me in solving different problems. I spend most of my time in problem solving and bug fixing in my code, I realize that Programming is about solving problems.

### Day 93: October 08, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I start making the appointments component user view preference. You can view appointments by day, by week, and by months (same in a calendar app). I also revised some of my code and add shadow to the side-menu when it is open.

**Thoughts**:      Seven days to go for my #100DaysOfCode Challenge. It feels really great to finish this challenge. I think I should delay my log and delay finishing this challenge to be able to finish my project and show something great in my Hundred Day.

### Day 94: October 10, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Spent 3-4 hours in coding today. And I'd be able to put a date in my appointments application. There's a lot to do in this project. I also had to add the time per appointment.

**Thoughts**:      Today I learn the importance of a unique key in v-for vuejs so I made a function that creates a unuqiue ID for each appointment.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 95: October 12, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I'd be able to 'display' the date for each appointment in my appointments project. You can now view your appointments on different days and toggle between days. I also insert an input tag in each cell to be able to use the v-model.

**Thoughts**:      I enjoyed coding today. So happy to solve problems! Five days to go to finish the challenge! I want to show something before this challenge ends.

### Day 96: October 14, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I add a time column and fix some errors in the appointments project. You can now set, view, and edit an appointment from any day, month, and year and do it without errors.

**Thoughts**:      I think in the last 4 days of the challenge I should give more time like never before to be able to finish and present the appointment component int the 100th day.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 97: October 16, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  I finally added the time to my appointments component app. I also fix its design. I plan to go and make the week view and month view of the appointments.

**Thoughts**:      I want to finish this component before this challenge ends and present it in twitter.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 98: October 19, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I add some validation to the appointments component so that you cannot add an appointment with an invalid time.

**Thoughts**:  I learn that when I import a model, I shall not use it on other components cause the model was a reference, it is global.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 99: October 21, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I start making the week-view for my appointment component. I created the data and variables needed so that I can display the day of the week for every appointment.

**Thoughts**:  Here we are to the final step that started in one step.
