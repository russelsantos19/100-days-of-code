# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I make a custom form validation for my sign-up page and I also try to use Vee-Validate.

**Thoughts:** Today I try to use vee-validate for my form validation but it gives me a hard time to import and use it. So I decided to continue my custom form validation in vue.
