### Day 40: August 03, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I finalized the design & clean the code of the profile creation page of my website. I set the box-shadow to inset in CSS and discover that it gives a 3-dimensional look to the form (I think Grinning face with smiling eyes).
			Then I made a pull request to my mentor. And I learn a lot and getting more familiar and improve in CSS. I learn how to add a custom placeholder to select tag because there is no such. I also make the page responsive.

**Thoughts**:  I spent 5 hours today in coding. And I see that if you want to do and finish something, your attention to time will lose. Just focus.

### Day 41: August 04, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  I made some adjustments to my code. I was told to create a separate component for a select tag that had so many options and make the current component long. I connect the parent & child component using refs and emit.

**Thoughts**:  I spent 3 hours in coding today. I realized that the way you solved a problem is based on your knowledge on different WAYS to solve it. So I have to study deeper in vue.js and find out more ways to solve a problem.
		I need to learn more on how to communicate parent-child relationship in components like using Bus.

### Day 42: August 05, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I spent two nearly 2 hours today in coding. I solved my problem on how to make a date dropdown(from DATE Object) that will output correct days based on the month given. (Ex: Feb. = 28 days).

**Thoughts**:  I learn something new and ANOTHER WAY to solve a problem, in #vuejs called lifecycle hooks. It's very useful. I used beforeMount to execute a function when page loads.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 43: August 06, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  I build the date dropdown that updates the day based on the month you selected. Ex: If you select feb, it had 28days.

**Thoughts**:  I look on facebook date dropdown and I can input invalid date like Feb 31. Maybe they are using server side validation.

### Day 44: August 07, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Another happy day because I finally solve my problem in making the date dropdown and finished revising my code.

**Thoughts**:  I've been little bit confused in some logic(and, or, nand, nor, etc) I had to study more of it to solve another problem regarding date form validation in my project.

**Link(s) to work**: [Veterinary Website](https://bitbucket.org/russelsantos/vets-vue/branch/dev)


### Day 45: August 09, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I study #veutify. I also add some form-validation. A complicated combination of 'and', 'or', 'not' gives me a hard time, and I took a review.

**Thoughts**:  I'm excited to apply veautify in my project. It does not come to my mind a 'component framework' that enables you to add ready-made component.
