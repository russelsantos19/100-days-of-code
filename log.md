# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23, 2020 Tuesday


**Today's Progress**: I make a custom form validation for my sign-up page and I also try to use Vee-Validate.

**Thoughts:** Today I try to use vee-validate for my form validation but it gives me a hard time to import and use it. So I decided to continue my custom form validation in vue.

### Day 6: June 28, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I start to build the log-in page with vue.js.

**Thoughts**: There are many codes uploaded online, you can just copy paste it and edit necessary code and design based on your preference. That's what I did today. And I also learn about making a line in css. It's fun.

### Day 7: June 29, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn a lot especially in using git. I show to my mentor/leader my sign up page and I make a pull request and he merged it to the master repo of the project that we are building. I also design the log-in page.

**Thoughts**: Do not commit different projects at the same time. Commit only the projects/codes related to each other and related to the commit description.
