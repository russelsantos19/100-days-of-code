# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I make a custom form validation for my sign-up page and I also try to use Vee-Validate.

**Thoughts:** Today I try to use vee-validate for my form validation but it gives me a hard time to import and use it. So I decided to continue my custom form validation in vue.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
