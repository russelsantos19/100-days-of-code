# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Russel Mendiola Santos

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 23, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Weeks ago, I started to study and build a website using vue.js. And today I begin to embrace the challenge to code at least an hour a day for 100days.
Today I make my own custom form validation for my sign up page. Vee-validate gave me a hard time to import.

### R1D2
Today I solve my problem and clean my code on my custom form validation. I also add some CSS to it. I learn a lot.

### R1D3
I made great progress today because my mentor taught me and correct my faults and wrong attitudes in coding. Today I'd be able to rapidly finish the sign-up page as it should be. It's almost finished I just have to clear some code and design.

### R1D4
Today I put an option sign-up with Facebook, Google, etc in my Sign-up Page.

### R1D5
Today I design and finish the sign-up page.

### R1D6
Today I start to build the log-in page with vue.js.

### R1D7
Today I learn a lot especially in using git. I show to my mentor/leader my sign up page and I make a pull request and he merged it to the master repo of the project that we are building. I also design the log-in page.

### R1D8
Today I continue building the log-in page.  And I think I can finish it tomorrow

### R1D9
Today I finished the responsive log-in page and add some vue.js code.

### R1D10
Today, I show my work to my mentor and he tells me things I need to change in my project. So I revise my code. And I tried to make my project a single page application.

### R1D11
Today, I converted my project to SFC(Single File Component). It gives me a hard time and I encountered a lot of errors. I want to use a vue-router to navigate in my components.

### R1D12
Today I take a break and I just give an hour in fixing errors in my code. Fixing some unknown errors is really time-consuming but today I see the error.

### R1D13
I'm so happy today because I finish my sign-in and sign up pages using vue.js and make a tab to toggle between the two. It was satisfying to solve a problem and build a project. Many more projects to come!

### R1D14
Today I clean and finalize my code and design of sign-in and sign-up page. And make a final commit it and push it.Tomorrow I'll show it to my mentor and make a pull request to the master repository.

### R1D15
Today I show my code to my mentor and he suggests things I need to change in my design. So I change my design and make it more simple and easy to understand for the end-user. I thank God for my mentor!

### R1D16
I accomplished a little today. I just study on vuex and on how can I link two different vue.js components in my project. I learn something and code little. I wish I could be faster these following days.

### R1D17
Today I learn a lot on how to pass data between components and that is through props and emitting custom events. I finally solve the problem in my code and this is really one of the happiest things in programming.

### R1D18
Today I finalize and clean the code and design in my simple sign-in/sign-up page based on what my mentor told me. I also created a close button. What a great day, I learn a lot. Tomorrow I plan to begin the side menu for my website.

### R1D19
Today I began the side menu of my website and I'll try to finish it tomorrow. I'll try to finish this project website before the end of this challenge. I really learn a lot not just by watching, not by reading, but by coding.

### R1D20
Today, my pull request was approved by my mentor. I also code the side menu for my website and it's almost finished. I learn something, especially about vue.js class and style binding.

### R1D21
Today I finished the side-menu for my website. It's really fun to solve a problem and finished a project. By the grace of God, I enjoy what I'm doing. This is my 3rd week and 100 days of code really helped me to code every day.

### R1D22
I'd be able to code a little today because I became busy in my sideline. But I'd be able to design some of the elements in my project.

### R1D23
I learn a lot today and update the code and design of the side navigation of my project website. I'll surely show this website to everyone once it's finished.

### R1D24
Today I put tiny lines between tabs and set white-space to no-wrap in CSS. I'm not so great in design but I think simplicity is beauty.

### R1D25
Today I study and design my project. I learn more about the power of flexbox in CSS. It is a time-saver and very useful in making a responsive web page.

### R1D26
I take a break today but code a little to fulfill my duty to code daily. #100DaysOfCode really put coding into my daily routine. I just add a design to my website and some arrow icon that shows to the tab you selected.

### R1D27
I'm so glad today because it's my first time deploying my projects on the web. I used #netlify. Here's the link to the projects I built in freecodecamp: https://russel.netlify.app

### R1D28
Today I redesign my project and add some icon on the side menu and the definition will appear when you click on it. I spent only two hours today. I learn a lot and enjoy it.

### R1D29
Today I spent nearly 4 hours in coding. And this is the final design of the side-menu(I think). I can't believe that it looks simple but it took me days to finish it. Maybe I need to give more hours a day in coding. Time for content!

### R1D30
Today I made a pull request of my code. I made a git rebase first to squash my commits to one. I learn more about origin, upstream, fetch, pull, etc in git. It's fun and I'm getting more familiar with it. Tom. I'll begin a new project.

### R1D31
More Git and Github stuff today. Because I had to change the remote repository I fork from. And it takes me some time. But I learn something, especially in ssh and https in git. Tomorrow I plan to begin the profile creation page.

### R1D32
Though I want to code straight for 100 days, I take a break yesterday cause I believe it is important not just for my productivity but also for my myself. Today I begin the profile creation page for my website.

### R1D33
Today I began to write the HTML of my new project and figure out its design.

### R1D34
I spend a little time today and continue to build my profile creation page. I need to renew my thought and focus and be motivated again.

### R1D35
Today I encountered a problem in using v-bind in src attribute in img tag that paralyzed me. I envy those people who made a lot of progress in a day. May the spirit of hard work and discipline be upon me. Tomorrow is another day.

### R1D36
I'm so happy & satisfied. I finally solved my problem in using v-bind in src attribute in img tag. I just import the image from assets and defined its width in CSS. I can now upload and display an image.

### R1D37
I build the javascript part of my website today and I'm getting more familiar with it. I learned that for me to be more productive, I should plan what to do and determined my goal for the day.

### R1D38
Today I designed the profile creation page of my website and it's nearly finished. 

### R1D39
Today I finished the profile creation page of my website based on the requirements given to me.

### R1D40
I finalized the design & clean the code of the profile creation page of my website. I set the box-shadow to inset in CSS and discover that it gives a 3-dimensional look to the form (I think Grinning face with smiling eyes). Then I made a pull request to my mentor.
I spent 5 hours today in coding. And I learn a lot and getting more familiar and improve in CSS. I learn how to add a custom placeholder to select tag because there is no such. I also make the page responsive.

### R1D41
I spent 3 hours in coding today. I made some adjustments to my code. I was told to create a separate component for a select tag that had so many options and make the current component long. I connect the parent & child component using refs and emit.

### R1D42
I spent two nearly 2 hours today in coding. I solved my problem on how to make a date dropdown(from DATE Object) that will output correct days based on the month given. (Ex: Feb. = 28 days). I learn something in #vuejs called lifecycle hooks.

### R1D43
I build the date dropdown that updates the day based on the month you selected. Ex: If you select feb, it had 28days. I look on facebook date dropdown and I can input invalid date like Feb 31. Maybe they are using server side validation.

### R1D44
Another happy day because I finally solve my problem in making the date dropdown and finished revising my code.

### R1D45
Today I study #veutify and I'm excited to apply it in my project. I also add some form-validation. A complicated combination of 'and', 'or', 'not' gives me a hard time, and I took a review.

### R1D46
I make my error message in form validation reactive(when the right answer was given, the error message will be removed). I also started to realize the usefulness of #npm. A lot of components are already made you just had to install it.

### R1D47
An amazing day for me cause I learn a lot today and finally solved my long-time problem regarding vue-router. I cannot use it bec. the 3.x version is not yet compatible with Vue 3. So I just updated it to 4.0 beta. I'm so happy.

### R1D48
Today I applied and used vue-router in my side-menu. Because before I just used v-show to hide and show the components. But now I understand the vue-router that it changes the URL and history. It's the right thing to do.

### R1D49
A satisfying and productive day. I finally finished another project. I've finished revising the side menu that uses vue-router and finalized the code and design. Tomorrow I'll begin a new project.

### R1D50
I'm now in the middle of my journey! Today, I began the 'clinic profile creation page'. To explain, the website we are building is a website for veterinary. We are four in a team that trains ourselves and I'm doing the frontend work.

### R1D51
I continue to build the clinic profile creation page today and I learned more on #vuetify and how to make a modal component.

### R1D52
I code a little today and finished the clinic-profile creation component. Tomorrow, I plan to put some overlay effect to it.

### R1D53
I've finally put overlay to my components. How I long to do this. I learned about: transition tag in vue, transition property in CSS, linear-gradient color, customizing scrollbar, etc.

### R1D54
I made a customize multi-select dropdown because I cannot use already made from npm because these libraries are not yet compatible with Vue 3. I also fixed my customize scrollbar. I'm glad I learn and did something no matter how small.

### R1D55
I spent only two hours. I've clear the design and function of my multi-select dropdown. Though I encounter an error and it gives me a hard time, I learned about and how to make #vuejs custom directives. It was amazing.

### R1D56
I spent four hours and really enjoy coding today but I had different things to do and I want to adjust my schedule. I fix the design and want to add some great functionality to the page. I learned about keyboard event handling.

### R1D57
I code little today and made some form-validation and function. I think I'm not fast enough and I want to change it. I'll show this project once it's finished. I also fix a bug.

### R1D58
I fix the responsiveness of the new page. I saw that as the project gets larger, the more time you need to spend in adding a feature because the code became complicated, & sometimes you need to adjust some code to fit the new feature.

### R1D59
I'm busy today on other things but I'd be able to code and fix bugs and error in my code and design(margin, z-index, position). One of these days I'll show the update to my website and I'll begin another project.

### R1D60
I fix the responsiveness of my side navigation for very small screen height, ex when you rotate your phone. I also made a function that converts a 24hr to 12hr format.

### R1D61
An hour today for my project and  I just add another button that pushes the collected data to an array and cleans the input fields. I spend the rest in fixing an error. I wonder how many percent of our coding time we gave to debugging errors?

### R1D62
A short but productive and happy coding time. I'd be able to sort the days of the week and make it always begin on Monday and so on whatever day you chose first. I also abled to display it in the select button and its reactive.

### R1D63
What I did: Display the selected day option in the form when you clicked a button, add a computed property for 12 hr. format of time, remove unnecessary code that hides dropdown. Today I learned about CSS methods, naming conventions and BEM.

### R1D64
Just an hour today for my project. I just clean my javascript code and make some elements reactive, the checkboxes will be disabled when you selected it and add it to the list. 

### R1D65
Spent an hour in coding and designing the day and time list on my project. I'd be able to also add the edit button if you want to edit the list. I'll do my best to code daily at least an hour cause I'll be busy these coming days at work.

### R1D66
It's a wonderful day! I finished the clinic profile creation component. It takes me some time but it's all worth it. I learned a lot. You can now set a different schedule for different days.

### R1D67
Spent 4hours today. I add form validation that makes the user unable to add schedule if there is no time to a day and vice versa. I also made the schedule object that will make the schedule easy to access when sent to the server.

### R1D68
Spent 4hrs and add the select all checkbox. It looks easy but it is not. Maybe I'm slow but I'm confident it was functioning well and no bugs whatever the user did. I made a pull request and will begin another feature for the website.

### R1D69
I made a new component for my website which is patient profile creation. I also fix a small error but takes me some time to find it. I wonder how long it takes to fixed an error to a very big project? I also update outdated packages.

### R1D70
I've finished the patient profile creation component based on the requirements. It's getting easier because I'm now familiar with it. I think the thrilling part of programming is you always learn something new.

### R1D71
I add the optional owner name input and ownership-date dropdown input to the component. So the component now had two date-dropdown input.

### R1D72
I finalized the code, design, and form validation of the profile creation page. It's great to learn about setCustomValidity, and pattern attribute in #HTML. It makes custom form validation easier by using only HTML.

### R1D73
I code for an hour and update the patient profile component based on what my mentor told me and study about API, cause I had to enable the page to receive data from the server. It's another thing to learn and a new challenge to face.

### R1D74
Spent 2.5 hours. I learned about #JSON and #AJAX. I also made some updates to species input and made it a dropdown input that receives the data from the server.

### R1D75
I've finished the species and common name dropdown in my patient component on the vets website. The common name dropdown will update base on the input selected from species dropdown.

### R1D76
I code little and revised my code based on my mentor told me. I clean the code and remove unnecessary data. And fix the design and remove some elements. A little bit busy.

### R1D77
I made another update to the code and clean it and then I made a pull request.

### R1D78
I began a new page for my website where you can view and edit appointments. It is a table of schedules that contains information about the client, the patient, etc.. Now it started to get complicated. Hope to finish well and fast.

### R1D79
I had to revise my code and apply MVVM architecture. So today, I study about #MVVM. I also learned and applied the toLocaleString method that converts a date object to a string, using locale settings.

### R1D80
I continue to study the MVVM architecture with Vue. I also updated and check my code with the release of Vue 3 today named after One Piece, my favorite anime.

### R1D81
Spent my time solving a logical error that appeared after I update to #vuejs 3 official release. I think there are some changes or something error with the Vue source code? When I go back to previous Vue RC, my code works well again.

### R1D82
I didn't post an update yesterday cause I'm stuck in reading and not coding, the same as today. However, I understand more about bundling and how Vite works. I also learned what is MVVM and what is Model, what is View, and what is ViewModel in vuejs.

### R1D83
Spent 3 hours and I'd separate the model from the view-model in my #vuejs code. I used and learned more about ES6 import and export.

### R1D84
I just fixed my code that I didn't finished yesterday. I fully separate the model from view-model. I wont be able to code well, my computer was so slow today! I think it was infected by Corona Virus lol. Hahah.

### R1D85
Today I apply the MVVM architecture, separate the model and other changes I made, across all the components I made in the past. I learn that when a project is getting bigger, a little change in your code takes time to do.

### R1D86
I'd finished updating and applying MVVM architecture to all the components of my Veterinary Website. I can finally begin a new feature for my website. I'll share the link here once this website was finished.

### R1D87
Today, I clean and finalized my code and made a pull request to my mentor. I learned about autocomplete property in HTML that was needed to add for the best experience of web users.

### R1D88
I learned about 'Separation of Concerns'. This is what I missed and what my mentor trying to teach me for the past week. But I did not apply bec. what I'm doing is SFC in vuejs. Now I understand. And I learned one of the common mistakes of a CodeNewbie

### R1D89
Today I start making the appointments component where the clinic can view and edit the appointments. It is a table of schedule that contains information about the client, patient, etc. It's my first time to use the table tag in HTML. 

### R1D90
I made this appointment list component on my website. It was thrilling and I felt much excitement while doing this new project. I saw my improvement and I'm faster than ever. There's a lot to add here like the time and design.

### R1D91
I just fix some error and design in my HTML table where I want to put a button. I just made a separate cell for the button and the problem was fixed. I also try to make the component focuses on the content when you click edit button.

### R1D92
I'm so happy today cause I solve many problems in my code. I learn about $nextTick in #vuejs, a function that executes a callback AFTER the DOM updates. I also solve another problem by applying scopes. Programming is about solving problems.

### R1D93
Today I start making the appointments component user view preference. You can view appointments by day, by week, and by months (same in a calendar app). I also revised some of my code and add shadow to the side-menu when it is open.

### R1D94
Spent 3-4 hours in coding today. And I'd be able to put a date in my appointments application. There's a lot to do in this project. I also had to add the time per appointment. Today I learn the importance of a unique key in v-for vuejs.

### R1D95
I'd be able to 'display' the date for each appointment in my appointments project. You can now view your appointments on different days and toggle between days. I also insert an input tag in each cell to be able to use the v-model.

### R1D96
I add a time column and fix some errors in the appointments project. You can now set, view, and edit an appointment from any day, month, and year and do it without errors.

### R1D97
I finally added the time to my appointments component app. I also fix its design. I plan to go and make the week view and month view of the appointments. I want to finish this component before this challenge ends and present it in twitter.

### R1D98
I add some validation to the appointments component so that you cannot add an appointment with an invalid time. I learn that when I import a model, I shall not use it on other components cause the model was a reference, it is global.

### R1D99
Here we are to the final step that started in one step. Today I start making the week-view for my appointment component. I created the data and variables needed so that I can display the day of the week for every appointment.
