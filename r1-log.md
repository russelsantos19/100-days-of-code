# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Russel Mendiola Santos

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 23, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Weeks ago, I started to study and build a website using vue.js. And today I begin to embrace the challenge to code at least an hour a day for 100days.
Today I make my own custom form validation for my sign up page. Vee-validate gave me a hard time to import.

### R1D2
Today I solve my problem and clean my code on my custom form validation. I also add some CSS to it. I learn a lot.

### R1D3
I made great progress today because my mentor taught me and correct my faults and wrong attitudes in coding. Today I'd be able to rapidly finish the sign-up page as it should be. It's almost finished I just have to clear some code and design.

### R1D4
Today I put an option sign-up with Facebook, Google, etc in my Sign-up Page.

### R1D5
Today I design and finish the sign-up page.

### R1D6
Today I start to build the log-in page with vue.js.

### R1D7
Today I learn a lot especially in using git. I show to my mentor/leader my sign up page and I make a pull request and he merged it to the master repo of the project that we are building. I also design the log-in page.

### R1D8
Today I continue building the log-in page.  And I think I can finish it tomorrow

### R1D9
Today I finished the responsive log-in page and add some vue.js code.

### R1D10
Today, I show my work to my mentor and he tells me things I need to change in my project. So I revise my code. And I tried to make my project a single page application.

### R1D11
Today, I converted my project to SFC(Single File Component). It gives me a hard time and I encountered a lot of errors. I want to use a vue-router to navigate in my components.

### R1D12
Today I take a break and I just give an hour in fixing errors in my code. Fixing some unknown errors is really time-consuming but today I see the error.

### R1D13
I'm so happy today because I finish my sign-in and sign up pages using vue.js and make a tab to toggle between the two. It was satisfying to solve a problem and build a project. Many more projects to come!

### R1D14
Today I clean and finalize my code and design of sign-in and sign-up page. And make a final commit it and push it.Tomorrow I'll show it to my mentor and make a pull request to the master repository.

### R1D15
Today I show my code to my mentor and he suggests things I need to change in my design. So I change my design and make it more simple and easy to understand for the end-user. I thank God for my mentor!

### R1D16
I accomplished a little today. I just study on vuex and on how can I link two different vue.js components in my project. I learn something and code little. I wish I could be faster these following days.

### R1D17
Today I learn a lot on how to pass data between components and that is through props and emitting custom events. I finally solve the problem in my code and this is really one of the happiest things in programming.

### R1D18
Today I finalize and clean the code and design in my simple sign-in/sign-up page based on what my mentor told me. I also created a close button. What a great day, I learn a lot. Tomorrow I plan to begin the side menu for my website.

### R1D19
Today I began the side menu of my website and I'll try to finish it tomorrow. I'll try to finish this project website before the end of this challenge. I really learn a lot not just by watching, not by reading, but by coding.
