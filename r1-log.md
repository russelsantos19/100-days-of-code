# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Russel Mendiola Santos

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 23, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Weeks ago, I started to study and build a website using vue.js. And today I begin to embrace the challenge to code at least an hour a day for 100days.
Today I make my own custom form validation for my sign up page. Vee-validate gave me a hard time to import.

### R1D2
Today I solve my problem and clean my code on my custom form validation. I also add some CSS to it. I learn a lot.

### R1D3
I made great progress today because my mentor taught me and correct my faults and wrong attitudes in coding. Today I'd be able to rapidly finish the sign-up page as it should be. It's almost finished I just have to clear some code and design.

### R1D4
Today I put an option sign-up with Facebook, Google, etc in my Sign-up Page.

### R1D5
Today I design and finish the sign-up page.

### R1D6
Today I start to build the log-in page with vue.js.

### R1D7
Today I learn a lot especially in using git. I show to my mentor/leader my sign up page and I make a pull request and he merged it to the master repo of the project that we are building. I also design the log-in page.

### R1D8
Today I continue building the log-in page.  And I think I can finish it tomorrow

### R1D9
Today I finished the responsive log-in page and add some vue.js code.

### R1D10
Today, I show my work to my mentor and he tells me things I need to change in my project. So I revise my code. And I tried to make my project a single page application.

### R1D11
Today, I converted my project to SFC(Single File Component). It gives me a hard time and I encountered a lot of errors. I want to use a vue-router to navigate in my components.

### R1D12
Today I take a break and I just give an hour in fixing errors in my code. Fixing some unknown errors is really time-consuming but today I see the error.

### R1D13
I'm so happy today because I finish my sign-in and sign up pages using vue.js and make a tab to toggle between the two. It was satisfying to solve a problem and build a project. Many more projects to come!

### R1D14
Today I clean and finalize my code and design of sign-in and sign-up page. And make a final commit it and push it.Tomorrow I'll show it to my mentor and make a pull request to the master repository.

### R1D15
Today I show my code to my mentor and he suggests things I need to change in my design. So I change my design and make it more simple and easy to understand for the end-user. I thank God for my mentor!

### R1D16
I accomplished a little today. I just study on vuex and on how can I link two different vue.js components in my project. I learn something and code little. I wish I could be faster these following days.

### R1D17
Today I learn a lot on how to pass data between components and that is through props and emitting custom events. I finally solve the problem in my code and this is really one of the happiest things in programming.

### R1D18
Today I finalize and clean the code and design in my simple sign-in/sign-up page based on what my mentor told me. I also created a close button. What a great day, I learn a lot. Tomorrow I plan to begin the side menu for my website.

### R1D19
Today I began the side menu of my website and I'll try to finish it tomorrow. I'll try to finish this project website before the end of this challenge. I really learn a lot not just by watching, not by reading, but by coding.

### R1D20
Today, my pull request was approved by my mentor. I also code the side menu for my website and it's almost finished. I learn something, especially about vue.js class and style binding.

### R1D21
Today I finished the side-menu for my website. It's really fun to solve a problem and finished a project. By the grace of God, I enjoy what I'm doing. This is my 3rd week and 100 days of code really helped me to code every day.

### R1D22
I'd be able to code a little today because I became busy in my sideline. But I'd be able to design some of the elements in my project.

### R1D23
I learn a lot today and update the code and design of the side navigation of my project website. I'll surely show this website to everyone once it's finished.

### R1D24
Today I put tiny lines between tabs and set white-space to no-wrap in CSS. I'm not so great in design but I think simplicity is beauty.

### R1D25
Today I study and design my project. I learn more about the power of flexbox in CSS. It is a time-saver and very useful in making a responsive web page.

### R1D26
I take a break today but code a little to fulfill my duty to code daily. #100DaysOfCode really put coding into my daily routine. I just add a design to my website and some arrow icon that shows to the tab you selected.

### R1D27
I'm so glad today because it's my first time deploying my projects on the web. I used #netlify. Here's the link to the projects I built in freecodecamp: https://russel.netlify.app

### R1D28
Today I redesign my project and add some icon on the side menu and the definition will appear when you click on it. I spent only two hours today. I learn a lot and enjoy it.

### R1D29
Today I spent nearly 4 hours in coding. And this is the final design of the side-menu(I think). I can't believe that it looks simple but it took me days to finish it. Maybe I need to give more hours a day in coding. Time for content!

### R1D30
Today I made a pull request of my code. I made a git rebase first to squash my commits to one. I learn more about origin, upstream, fetch, pull, etc in git. It's fun and I'm getting more familiar with it. Tom. I'll begin a new project.

### R1D31
More Git and Github stuff today. Because I had to change the remote repository I fork from. And it takes me some time. But I learn something, especially in ssh and https in git. Tomorrow I plan to begin the profile creation page.

### R1D32
Though I want to code straight for 100 days, I take a break yesterday cause I believe it is important not just for my productivity but also for my myself. Today I begin the profile creation page for my website.

### R1D33
Today I began to write the HTML of my new project and figure out its design.
